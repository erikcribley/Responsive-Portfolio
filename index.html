                    This is soon to be my portfolio page. It is empty now, but only because I haven't done anything yet. 
                    Give me about six months and it'll be bursting with projects demonstrating my new found aptitude in the
                    field of Full Stack Development. Return in the future and marvel at my code!
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    When you return you should hire me. I can be reached via the contact page, which in the future will have 
                    functionality in addition to aesthetically pleasing design. Helping me escape the fifty-plus hour a week drudgery
                    of driving a tow motor around a warehouse will earn you my eternal gratitude. You can't put a price on eternal 
                    gratitude!
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Or e-mail me at ErikCribley@gmail.com. Gmail works now and in the future.
